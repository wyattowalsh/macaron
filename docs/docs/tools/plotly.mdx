[`Plotly`](https://plotly.com/) is an open-source graphing library for Python that enables the creation of interactive, publication-quality graphs. Built on top of the `plotly.js` JavaScript library, Plotly supports a wide range of chart types, including scientific, 3D, statistical, and financial charts. It integrates seamlessly with Jupyter notebooks and can be used in standalone HTML files or Dash applications, making it a versatile tool for data visualization.

## Usage Example

Here's a simple example of using Plotly to create a scatter plot:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
df = px.data.iris()

# Create scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(df, x='sepal_width', y='sepal_length', color='species',
                 title='Sepal Width vs. Sepal Length')

# Show plot
fig.show()
```

In this example, Plotly Express is used to create a scatter plot of the Iris dataset, with points colored by species.
