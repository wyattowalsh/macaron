[`pytest-html`](https://pytest-html.readthedocs.io/) is a plugin for the `pytest` testing framework that generates HTML reports for test results. It enhances the readability and sharing of test outcomes by providing a user-friendly, web-based format. The plugin supports customization of the report's appearance and content, allowing developers to tailor the reports to their specific needs.

## Usage Example

To generate an HTML report for your test suite, run the following command:

```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```

This command executes your tests and produces an `report.html` file containing the results. To create a self-contained report with embedded assets, use:

```bash
pytest --html=report.html --self-contained-html
```

This approach ensures that all necessary resources are included within the HTML file, making it easier to share and view the report without external dependencies.
