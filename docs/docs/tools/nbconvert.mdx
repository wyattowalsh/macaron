[`nbconvert`](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/) is a Jupyter tool that allows users to convert Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files into various static formats, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Markdown, and reStructuredText. This facilitates sharing notebooks in different formats and integrating them into workflows that require specific document types. Additionally, `nbconvert` can execute notebooks programmatically, making it useful for batch processing and automated reporting.

## Usage Example

To convert a Jupyter Notebook to an HTML file using the command line:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to html your_notebook.ipynb
```

This command generates an HTML file (`your_notebook.html`) from the specified notebook. Similarly, to convert to a PDF:

```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf your_notebook.ipynb
```

For more advanced usage, such as executing notebooks before conversion or customizing the output, refer to the [official documentation](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/).
