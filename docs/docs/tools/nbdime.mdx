[`nbdime`](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/) is a toolset designed for diffing and merging Jupyter Notebooks. Traditional line-based diff tools often struggle with the JSON structure of notebook files, leading to unclear diffs and merge conflicts. `nbdime` addresses this by providing content-aware diffing and merging, understanding the structure of notebooks to offer clear and meaningful comparisons. It includes command-line utilities and web-based interfaces for visualizing differences and resolving conflicts, enhancing collaboration and version control workflows involving Jupyter Notebooks.

## Usage Example

To compare two Jupyter Notebooks using the command line:

```bash
nbdiff notebook_1.ipynb notebook_2.ipynb
```

For a web-based diff visualization:

```bash
nbdiff-web notebook_1.ipynb notebook_2.ipynb
```

To integrate `nbdime` with Git for better handling of notebook diffs and merges:

```bash
nbdime config-git --enable --global
```

This command configures Git to use `nbdime` for notebook files, improving the clarity of diffs and facilitating conflict resolution.
