[`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) is a Python tool that facilitates dependency management and packaging. It allows developers to declare the libraries their project depends on and manages (installs/updates) them efficiently. Poetry offers a lockfile to ensure repeatable installs and can build your project for distribution, streamlining the development workflow.

## Usage Examples

### Creating a New Project
Create a new project directory with a basic structure:
```bash
poetry new my-project
```

### Adding Dependencies
Add a package as a dependency to your project:
```bash
poetry add requests
```

Add a development dependency (e.g., for testing or linters):
```bash
poetry add pytest --dev
```

### Installing Dependencies
Install all the dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`:
```bash
poetry install
```

### Running Scripts
Run a script or command in the context of the projectâ€™s virtual environment:
```bash
poetry run python my_project/main.py
```

### Managing the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

Deactivate the virtual environment by simply exiting the shell session.

### Updating Dependencies
Update specific dependencies:
```bash
poetry update requests
```

Update all dependencies to the latest compatible versions:
```bash
poetry update
```

### Building and Publishing
Build the project for distribution:
```bash
poetry build
```

Publish the project to a package index (e.g., PyPI):
```bash
poetry publish --username <username> --password <password>
```

### Listing Dependencies
Show the installed dependencies and their versions:
```bash
poetry show --tree
```
