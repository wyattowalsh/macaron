[`jupyterlab-git`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git) is a JupyterLab extension that integrates Git version control into the JupyterLab interface. It provides a user-friendly graphical interface to perform common Git operations such as cloning repositories, staging changes, committing, pushing, pulling, and viewing diffs, all within JupyterLab. This integration enhances the workflow for data scientists and researchers by combining code development and version control in a single environment.
