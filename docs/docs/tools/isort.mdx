[`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) is a Python utility and library that automatically sorts imports alphabetically and organizes them into sections. It enhances code readability and maintainability by ensuring a consistent import order across your codebase. `isort` can be used as a command-line tool, integrated into your development workflow, or configured to run automatically before commits.

## Usage Example

To sort imports in a specific Python file, run:

```bash
isort your_script.py
```

To apply `isort` recursively to all Python files in a directory:

```bash
isort .
```

To view the changes `isort` would make without applying them:

```bash
isort your_script.py --diff
```

For integration with code editors, `isort` offers plugins and can be configured to run on save or as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
